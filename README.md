# Morse-code-translator
This is a Morse code translator which is implemented using the Turing machine in Jflap software.

## ℹ️ Installations:
1. Java jdk
2. Jflap software - [Jflap](http://www.jflap.org/) 
Download 7.1 version of the software

## ❔ How to start?
1. Once the software is installed, open it and from prefernces -> turing machine prefernces -> enable transitions from turing machine final state.
2. Now select 'Turing machine' in the listed options.
3. Go to files on the bar, select 'open' and go to the path where you downloaded it and click on 'open'
4. Select 'Standard Turing Machine' from the window displayed after clicking on open.
5. You can run by steps or single run from 'Input' option on the bar.
6. Give any morse code word, where one letter is separated by space as input.
7. It will reject the input if the given morse code is incorrect.
8. Displays the word translated into English if accepted.

## Future scope:
To make this machine translate sentences, prsenetly tranlates only words even given a sentence gives it as single word.
